# AlphaHackathon

This project was developed at [<Academia de Código_>](https://www.academiadecodigo.org), during the 18º Bootcamp hackathon.



## Development Tools

In this project we used all our Java knowledge and also LibGdx fundamentals.



## Game History

The theme of our project was the Queen's song - "Under Pressure". From this song we created an app that pops up every 5,15,30 or 60 minutes according to the timer setted.
This will pop up a game that has three levels of 30 seconds each and it's designed to relief pressure that employees at IT companies are used to. It will take only one and a half minute and will not take much time from the employee and will certainly increase the company productivity.  

## Rules
You will have three levels and the controls are allways the arrow keys.
```python
<UP> - move up
<DOWN> - move down
<LEFT> - move left
<RIGHT> - move right
```
You will also have three lifes per level and a timer that if it reaches zero, you lose! It's pressure time!
